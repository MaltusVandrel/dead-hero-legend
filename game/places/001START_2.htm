    <p>"Maybe that's why I drifted there with all of my unconscious hope. &mdash; Good to know that my heart still dreams."</p>
    <p>"Nothing but beauty for so long, the time is such of a meaningless thing for me that I can't even count waves anymore 
        &mdash; If I could, maybe I would be crazy at this point; Or would I be saner?"

    <p>"Then, so expected but of no short of surprise and happiness, I found such a sad thing."</p>
    <p>"A drowned body, a hopeless grey thing; for now."</p>
    <p><em>"Be back to what you were, raise dear unknown but soon to be friend!"</em></p>
    <p>A body, half-decomposed, half-eaten, returned to a healthy, and more surprisingly, 
        an alive state with its true soul flowing back from the ocean grip to its rightful owner.</p>

    <p>"Let's see what I caught."</p>
    <p>The watcher inspected the floating one, permeating the peaceful unaware continuousness.</p> 
    <p>The undrowned sensed a disembodied will, much like a voice but without sound, compelling to answer:</p>
    <p>"What is your name, yet-to-be friend?"</p>
